Proof of Concept Project in ASP.NET MVC Core. Querying external aviation weather API, retrieving and displaying flight-rules for user-requested airport(s).

## ASP.NET CORE (MVC)
Written entirely in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac, the project utilizes a few model classes, a single controller that calls out to a single external REST API (AVWX), and a single view wherein the markup and Razor syntax reside.  Bootstrap (sooo edgy!) used for responsive styling and component templating. 

## Future Goals: 
I intend to eventually rewrite the client-side in Vue.js framework to really kick it up a couple notches as far as reactivity.
